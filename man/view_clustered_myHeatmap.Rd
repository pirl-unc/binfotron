\arguments{
\item{my_pack}{A named list for analysis modules to send parameters to the view function in a 
more compact fashion:
\itemize{
  \item sample_names
  \item groups
  \item input_df
  \item base_file_name
  \item base_title
  \item output_dir
  \item pdf_metadata
  \item argument_list
  \item my_model
  \item annotation
  \item FDR_pValue
  \item pValue
  \item fold_change
}
These list items may be overridden by specifying them individually.  They are described in 
more detail below.}

\item{sample_names}{Overrides \code{my_pack$sample_names}. Should be the sample names you want to have for 
the scaled values. They should be in the order you want them displayed. They should correspond to the rows 
of input_df. They should have the same order as thier groups.}

\item{groups}{Overrides \code{my_pack$groups} A factored vector indicating what groups the 
samples belong to.  Should be the same length as \code{sample_names}. Their order should match sample_names.
They should be factored with the order matching the order in which they should be displayed. They should be 
formatted how you would like them displayed.}

\item{input_df}{Overrides \code{my_pack$input_df} A data frame with one row per sample.  Column names should
correspond to the features along the y axis of the heatmap. Row order should correspond to the samples/groups
should be in the order in which you would like them displayed.}

\item{base_title}{Overrides \code{my_pack$base_title}. String to specify the title of the graph.}

\item{base_file_name}{Overrides \code{my_pack$base_file_name}. String to specify the file name.}

\item{output_dir}{Overrides \code{my_pack$output_dir}. Path to folder where the heatmap output should go.
Analysis modules will determine this automatically.}

\item{pdf_metadata}{Overrides \code{my_pack$pdf_metadata}. Contains data from the arguments list that should
be put in the metadata of the pdf.}

\item{models_argument_list}{Overrides \code{my_pack$argument_list}.  Lists all of the arguments sent to the 
analysis module.}

\item{imported_annotation}{Overrides \code{my_pack$annotation}. Annotations describe the 
steps taken during the analysis module and previous steps. This function will also add 
annotation steps to provide a full description of how the graph was generated.}

\item{my_model}{Overrides \code{my_pack$my_model}. Links to all graphs are logged on a d3.js table. This variable 
will specify what model name was used to generate the graph on that table.}

\item{FDR_pValue}{Overrides \code{my_pack$FDR_pValue}. Numeric vector with length equal to \code{ncol(input_df)}. 
If \code{FDR_threshhold} is not \code{NULL} then only features with an \code{FDR_pValue} less than the 
\code{FDR_threshhold} will be included.}

\item{pValue}{Overrides \code{my_pack$pValue}. Numeric vector with length equal to \code{ncol(input_df)}.
If \code{pValue_threshhold} is not \code{NULL} then only features with a \code{pValue} less than the

'higher' fold change indicates group2 was higher than group1.}

\item{base_for_log_transform}{Integer indicating the base to transform the data, which will be shown in the averages.

This axis can get cluttered quickly if there are a lot of samples.}

\item{append_classifier_to_sample_name}{Boolean indicating whether the sample group should be added to the end of the sample names.
This option isn't really needed after having added facet titles.}

\item{panel_label_switch}{'x' switches the x axis label to the bottom. \code{NULL} leaves the labels where they are.}

\item{panel.strip.background}{For specifying the element_rect of the panel strip background (eg. \code{element_rect(fill = 'gray95')}).}

\item{panel.strip.text.x}{For specifying the element_rect of the panel strip (eg. \code{element_text(size=18, angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0)}.}

\item{pValue_threshhold}{If not \code{NULL}, features with an \code{pValue} above this value will not be shown.}

\item{display_all_names}{Boolean indicating whether the feature names should be displayed along the y axis.}

\item{graph_rel_widths}{Numeric vector of length 2 (eg. \code{c(8, 2.5)}) whose ratio determines the size of the individual sample panel vs the 
averages.}

\value{
Several outputs are produced: 
  1) Heatmaps; 
  2) Heatmaps pdf;
  3) An annotation file describing the steps taken on the data from start to finish;
  4) A matrix file containing the sample z-scores for each sample and the average values displayed in the heatmap;
  5) If \code{log_completion == TRUE}, a link is made to the pdf on the d3.js html indexing 
    table using \code{add_to_completed_analyses}.
}
\description{
Produces a heatmap of scaled values by row and then makes an unscaled average value column to the right of it.
}
\details{
\code{view_clustered_myHeatmap} was created to make heatmaps of gene expression data, although it could
be used to display the distribution of any numeric features.
It's important to not scale data prior to heatmap to not disrupt average values.
